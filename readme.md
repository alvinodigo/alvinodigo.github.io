A place to store my nerd stuff. And my jobs, of course. cough cough
(beta version)

Here are a lot of stuff made with only CSS. =)

It's a landing page with some links to another pages, containing famous characters from games, anime, movies and cartoons, all made by myself with only CSS (I'm kidding, there are some HTML and JS... This part is only to view easter eggs. Yes, there are a few easter eggs! Click on some elements and see if something happens), just for fun and to study possibilities, to practice the visual side of an internet page.

I'm a frontend developer since 2008 and I love all the interface side of projects(although I do both). So the challenge for me here is to make things without use any image or similar thing to cheat the thing.

Feel free to take a look and, perhaps, use (if you want =) ).

This is a page with some projects containing draws of famous characters from games, anime, movies and cartoons, all made by myself with only __CSS__ (I'm kidding, there are some HTML and JS. =D ), just for fun, to study and to practice __CSS__ techniques.

Thes JS part is only to add easter eggs to the project. Yes, there are easter eggs! Click on some elements and see if something happens.

About me:  
__I'm a frontend developer since 2008__ and I love all about the visual side of internet pages(although I do both, frontend(visual) and backend(usually not visual)).

So the challenge for me here is to draw nerd things without use any image or similar to cheat.

Feel free to take a look and, if you want, use this. =)

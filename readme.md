A place to store my nerd stuff. And my jobs, of course. cough cough

It's a landing page with some links to another pages, containing famous characters from games, anime, movies and cartoons, all made by myself with only __CSS__ (I'm kidding, there are some HTML and JS. =D This part is only to view easter eggs. Yes, there are a few easter eggs! Click on some elements and see if something happens), just for fun and to study possibilities, to practice the visual side of an internet page.

__I'm a frontend developer since 2008__ and I love all the interface side of projects(although I do both). So the challenge for me here is to make things without use any image or similar thing to cheat the thing.

Feel free to take a look and, perhaps, use (if you want =) ).
